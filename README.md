# Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

ðŸ“Š **Power BI Dashboard + ðŸ“ˆ Machine Learning Models**

This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using a **2-in-1 approach**:
- **Power BI Dashboard** for interactive insights.
- **Machine Learning (Python/Jupyter)** for churn prediction.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
Customer churn is a major business challenge.  
This project provides:
- **Visual insights** into churn drivers (contract type, tenure, payment method, etc.).
- **ML models** to predict Accuracy, precision and recall.

---

## ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard
Key findings:
- **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn (~42.7%).
- **Two-year contracts** show the lowest churn (~2.8%).
- **Electronic check** customers churn the most.
- Gender has little impact on churn.
